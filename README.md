# Travel App 

Travel is one of the first applications you create during the TTS immersion course.  This repository is intended to serve as a guide.  

Some notes about this application
  - It uses the Bootstrap gem, not the CDN
  - Some of the code may have been overwritten, as we progress in class.

To get started:

1) bundle install
2) rails db:migrate
3) rails db:seed
